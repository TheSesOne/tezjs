# Tez Directory    

Tezjs uses the `.tez` directory to generates the code based upon the components/pages/layouts defined in the project directory.    

**Note :**  There isn't need to any changes in any directory inside it. While tez dev is run then it will recreate .tez directory.    

**This directory will help you to dive more into creation of  files bases of your folder structure in tezjs**
