
## Dist Directory   

Tezjs creates a `/dist` directory to build your application for production.    

**Note :** There is no need to change in any file inside it. While `tez build` is run it will recreate /dist directory. 

The one of the most beautiful part of TezJS framework is, it automatically segregate the components page wise and create the pre/post script page wise which helps to improve the core web vital score. TezJS framework fully follows the [core web vital guidelines](https://web.dev/vitals/) and apply those in necessary areas of the application automatically like set the preload, preloadmodule, preconnect, dns-preconnect, segregate the priority based loading etc without developer intervention..
