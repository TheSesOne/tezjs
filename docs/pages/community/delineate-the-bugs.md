# Delineate the Bugs
Delineating the bugs is one of the most important roles in open source, this gives an opportunity to build the framework more robust day by day. TezJS community developers look into it and fix the same. If you know the solution to the bug then feel free to create a pull request. We are happy to add a new enthusiastic contributor in our friendly community.

# Before Reporting the Bug
We would suggest before creating a bug ticket, you can search the issue in the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/tezjs/tezjs/discussions) as well as [open/closed issues](https://github.com/tezjs/tezjs/issues). If you don't find something intuitive and if you are unsure about the issue then the best approach is to start the discussion on our [Github Discussion](https://github.com/tezjs/tezjs/discussions).

# Create a minimal reproduction
It's important to report the issue with minimal reproducible steps, this help to review and fix it quickly rather than putting up the extra code of your project.
You can create an issue example in stackblitz and reference the link to the issue ticket.
